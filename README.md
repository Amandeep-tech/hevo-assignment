This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


About the Project:

Built with reusable components: 
    FeatureCard (for each feature with animated progress) and FeatureImage (for the right-side image).

Animation Flow:
    The active card shows a circular progress animation on its border using Tailwind CSS and framer-motion. When the animation completes, the next card becomes active and the right image updates.

Responsiveness:
    The layout is fully responsive using Tailwind CSS, working well on both desktop and mobile screens.

Dynamic Rendering:
    Features are rendered from a data array, making it easy to add or remove cards in the future.

User Interaction:
    Clicking any card stops the auto-animation and activates that card immediately.



## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
